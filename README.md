Space Alpha White Paper
Version 0.1

Incubating, and scaling the emerging low-carbon economy

A decentralised currency, everybody can obtain, and where each currency holder contributes through his financial decisions to the market value. Depending on the value, opportunities may arise which offer the chance to make investments into the global emerging low carbon economy.

1. Motivation
Most people are aware that our climate is changing with ever increasing carbon emissions. [1] In recent years our understanding has grown, and our civilization today faces multiple threats from a different climate regime, including more extreme weather and sea level rise. At the same time more and more businesses and governments learned that the low-carbon economy creates jobs and opportunities. But process is often slow, especially when looking at our addiction to fossil fuel driven cars, or power generation. Often actions are done with a top-down approach, or delayed.

There is room for more global initiative and cooperation when channeling funds into a diverse range of projects and technologies. This could take shape in form of supporting existing - proven successful endeavours, or to help jumpstart, and give required incentives.

The time has come to accelerate our collective efforts to reduce carbon emissions, to kick out old habits and to embrace clean technology,  to empower the most promising actions.In our daily lives we use currencies, why not use one which at the same time can help to solve one of the most pressing issues?

Even the biggest waves of change start with just a few ripples. You’ll need a multi-decade strategy for making business sense of the carbon vortex, but the only way to get there is to start somewhere — and to start today. - John Elkington

The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report concluded that "It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century." p.17 https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_TS_FINAL.pdf  The largest human influence has been the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. p.89 https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf
2. Vision
2.1 Introduction to Space Alpha
Space Alpha Tokens (SAT) are a Ethereum token currency based on smart contracts, with the goal to combine financing and the goal to achieve emissions reductions on a global scale. Space Alpha was founded in January 2018, and is headquartered in Berlin, Germany. Space Alpha plans an initial offering of a small amount of tokens prior to the Initial Coin Offering (ICO), during 2018.  Current efforts center around extending our team with more qualified experts, and to  establish our business operations.

2.2 Our vision of the low-carbon economy
Processes or technologies that produce substantially lower amounts of carbon dioxide emissions than is emitted from conventional fossil fuel power generation, or from processes in a production or supply chain, or through packaging and the related waste management. Low-carbon economy for Space Alpha includes power generation sources such as wind and solar power, and process electrification (transportation, power supply, heating). Ideally a carbon neutral or even carbon negative result is achieved, which also depends on a lifecycle evaluation.

2.3 Attitudes and engagement
While there is a majority of people's attitudes towards climate action, it lacks massive deployment and real behavioral change.

2.4 Transportation
Tesla's new lower priced car the Model 3, with over half a million reservations, is delayed for months. Things need to be scaled, and it takes time. However, there other less known car models readily available, but still electric charging station infrastructure might turn potential buyers away. Car sharing or electric charging stations offer many new opportunities, require a new infrastructure, and secure technology, everywhere.

2.5 Energy

According to the REN21, Renewables 2017 Global Status Report the amount of solar and wind in the energy mix is still small (Figure 1.). Yet, experts calculate that decarbonization of the electricity system by 2050 is possible and at lower costs than today, based on available technology.

According to the Frankfurt School-UNEP Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment report from 2017, since 2010 investments in renewables vary between $234 billion to $312 billion annually.  Today, manufacturing scale-up, and the roll-out have become a function of market financing (Figure 2.).



The investor hunger for existing wind and solar farms is a strong signal for the world to move to renewables. - Udo Steffens, president of Frankfurt School of Finance & Management

2.6 Carbon capture
We see great potential in bio-energy with carbon capture and storage, especially in the industry scale generation of biochar and its byproducts and many benefits. 

2.7 Digital assets
The current cryptocurrency market capitalization of roughly $800 billion offers investors the opportunity to diversify their digital assets. Space Alpha Tokens tap into this market, and at the same time finances renewable energy sources and relevant projects, for instance maintenance tasks.

3. Capabilities
A healthy token ecosystem is vital for investors, and for the prospects and capabilities of Space Alpha's investment portfolio. The vitality of the economic SAT network depends foremost on market value, and our success in directing funds. We are committed to the development of the required analytic applications, as well as a strong vetting process. The Space Alpha Board of Advisors, and existing results and track records, guide our decisions in how to financially improve roll-out and manufacturing of low-carbon technologies.

3.1 The Space Alpha Token ecosystem
3.2 Investments
With growing market capitalization of SAT, opportunities emerge for Space Alpha to direct investments to our transportation, energy, and carbon capture visions. Selected and vetted companies are offered funding, in return they buy SAT for the amount of funds received, but only if they become profitable. In the beginning we will focus or efforts on healthy entities, with a low risk of loses. 

Ideal example

A year old startup in Texas which specializes in constructing and maintaining electric vehicle charging stations receives a fund of $10.000 to buy standardized universal charging stations. After a year they report positive results, and begin to buy SAT until they reach $10.000, and transfer them back to our Token fund, returning the investment to Space Alpha. This would require a currency exchange which trades SAT and accepts fiat currency.

If the initial funding stage was a success we might consider the same company for another fund. This time we help to finance the conversation of their vehicle fleet to electric propulsion. Because there are not many strings attached, this model heavily depends on our initial company assessment, a trust model.

Another form of investment is to fund a company, without directly returning investment.

Ideal example

An established company committed to the production of biochar from waste as a garden soil amendment receives $50.000 to help finance a small scale industrial biochar plant. In return they offer SAT as a payment option to their customers. 



3.3 Realisation of Benefits
Benefits manifest through the market capitalization of SAT, and from returning funds and a growing network of companies accepting SAT as a payment option.
